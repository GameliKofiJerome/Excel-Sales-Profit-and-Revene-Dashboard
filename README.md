# Excel-Sales-Profit-and-Revenue-Dashboard
- This excel project is an analysis on on sales data from different regions of the world.
- It was done using pivot tables to explore and summarize the Sales dataset, analyze related totals and present summary reports.
- Pivot charts were used to show relationship between sales, profit and revenue for multiple data variables in the dataset.
- I have included both the data and the accompanying dashboard file in this repository 
- Feel free to play around and learn with them.
